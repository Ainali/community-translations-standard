# Community translations of the Standard for Public Code

This is a repository for unofficial translations of the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net), provided by the community.

## Contribute

Anyone may start a translation of the standard.
Please place your translation in a folder named with [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code (for example `es` for Spanish or `da` for Danish).
